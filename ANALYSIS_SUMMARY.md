## 💡 Key Recommendations

### 1. Technology Stack
**Recommendation:** Choose **Next.js + TailwindCSS + Sanity CMS**

**Rationale:**
- Meets 4-5 week timeline with room for quality
- Full customization for unique requirements
- Best-in-class performance and SEO
- Scalable for future parent portal features
- Portfolio-worthy modern stack
- Lower long-term costs

**Alternative:** Webflow if speed is absolutely critical (can launch in 3-4 weeks)

### 2. Design Approach
- Use soft color palette (pastels + warm neutrals)
- Leverage shadcn/ui for rapid component development
- Mobile-first, accessibility-first design
- Focus on trust signals (credentials, testimonials, safety)
- Keep design warm, simple, and reassuring

### 3. Development Strategy
- Set up complete infrastructure first (days 1-2)
- Build component library before pages
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement CMS early for parallel content work
- Deploy to staging from day 1
- Test on real devices throughout

### 4. Content Strategy
- Start content gathering immediately
- Priority: Logo, hero photos, homepage text
- Use placeholder content for development
- Review [`CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md`](./CONTENT_CHECKLIST.md) thoroughly
- Allocate time for professional photography
- Gather testimonials with written permissions

## 🎓 Architectural Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
```
Next.js 14 (App Router)
├── Server Components (default)
├── Client Components (interactive)
├── API Routes (form submissions)
└── Static Generation (programs, staff pages)
```

### Data Flow
```
User Request → Next.js → Sanity CMS → CDN
                      ↓
              Form Submissions → API → Database → Email
```

### Key Patterns
- **SSG** for static content (programs, staff, about)
- **ISR** for frequently updated content (testimonials)
- **CSR** for interactive elements (forms, carousels)
- **API Routes** for form handling and email

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Must-Haves
- ✅ WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Privacy policy (required for forms)
- ✅ Photo permissions (for children's images)
- ✅ HTTPS/SSL (via Vercel/Webflow)
- ✅ Form validation and sanitization
- ✅ Rate limiting on forms

### Optional Enhancements
- Cookie consent banner
- GDPR compliance (if serving EU)
- Terms of service
- Content Security Policy headers

---

## 💰 Budget Estimates

### Development Costs
- **Solo Developer:** 100-130 hours
- **Rate (example):** $75-150/hour
- **Total:** $7,500-19,500

### Monthly Operating Costs

#### Next.js Stack
| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Vercel (Hobby) | $0 |
| Sanity (Free tier) | $0 |
| Resend (Free tier) | $0 |
| Domain | $1.25/mo |
| **Total** | **$0-20/mo** |

Scale to Pro plans as needed:
- Vercel Pro: $20/mo
- Sanity Growth: $99/mo
- Resend Pro: $20/mo
- **Total Pro:** $140/mo

#### Webflow Stack
- Webflow CMS: $23/mo
